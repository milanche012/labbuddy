My project is simple... in my free-time make a open souce laboratory management application than can be used in a mycrobiology and/or
a chemistry laboratory.
#=======================================================================================================================
At the ond of the LAB BUDDY project I hope to integrate:
1. Lab results management
2. Methodology library with calculator
3. Work load and Team management
4. Stock management
5. Speach Recognition for free-hand use of the application (reducing the risk of diseases spreading through the lab.)

In the V0.1. the Lab results management is more or less done. My plan is to refine the log-in sistem with 3 lvls of permision:
-lvl 1 / find results
-lvl 2 / lvl 1 + add results
-lvl 3 / lvl 2 + edit results
with sublvl A (just chemistry lab), B (just microbiology lab) and C (A+B)
